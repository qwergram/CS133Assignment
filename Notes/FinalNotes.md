# What will be on the C++ Final:

## First 2 are one line code problems
1. One line a code that does a task, no loops but stuff from `#include <algorithm>`
2. One line a code that does a task, no loops [algorithms] e.g. sort, foreach, transform, copy
  - Require passing in lambda, functor or function
## Heaps, BST and AVLS; data structures!
3. Picture of a diagraph
  - Bft and dft
4. Heap one
  - Same thing as the quiz 9
  - Used numbers
  - Only 10 things
  - Draw the arrays
5. BST
  - Traversals
  - Preorder/inorder/postorder
6. AVL
  - Insertion
  -	Deletion
## Inheriting from base classes: inherit publicy, add a function, make sure it doesn’t crash. It will inherit without the template feature Wew. Print out source code for project 2 and project 3.
7. Based on two classes we’ve used
  -	Write class definition given starting class in project 3
  - Write a Public inherited class
  - Not allowed to use any methods already inherited
    -	Except accessors/mutators
      - No iterators
  -.	No other data structures
  -.	Recursively only
  -.	Manipulating the tree, no const keyword
  -.	Return true if successful, false if unsuccessful
  -.	Must be O(?)
  -.	Catch all exceptions
8. Starting point: doubly linked list (project 2), pushback, popback, iterator
  - One difference: anything private is protected
  - Writing a child class
    - Not a template `intlist = list<int>`
  - Write a method given O(?)
  - Catch all exceptions
  - Return true if successful, false if unsuccessful
  - Method will change data, will not have const keyword
