# What will be on the C++ Final:

## First 2 are one line code problems
1. One line a code that does a task, no loops but stuff from #include <algorithm>
2. One line a code that does a task, no loops [algorithms] e.g. sort, foreach, transform, copy
  a. Require passing in lambda, functor or function
## Heaps, BST and AVLS; data structures!
3. Picture of a diagraph
  a.	Bft and dft
4.	Heap one
  a.	Same thing as the quiz 9
  b.	Used numbers
  c.	Only 10 things
  d.	Draw the arrays
5.	BST
  a.	Traversals
  b.	Preorder/inorder/postorder
6.	AVL
  a.	Insertion
  b.	Deletion
## Inheriting from base classes: inherit publicy, add a function, make sure it doesn’t crash. It will inherit without the template feature Wew. Print out source code for project 2 and project 3.
7.	Based on two classes we’ve used
  a.	Write class definition given starting class in project 3
  b.	Write a Public inherited class
  c.	Not allowed to use any methods already inherited
    i.	Except accessors/mutators
      ii.	No iterators
  d.	No other data structures
  e.	Recursively only
  f.	Manipulating the tree, no const keyword
  g.	Return true if successful, false if unsuccessful
  h.	Must be O(?)
  i.	Catch all exceptions
8.	Starting point: doubly linked list (project 2), pushback, popback, iterator
  a.	One difference: anything private is protected
  b.	Writing a child class
    i.	Not a template intlist = list<int>
  c.	Write a method given O(?)
  d.	Catch all exceptions
  e.	Return true if successful, false if unsuccessful
  f.	Method will change data, will not have const keyword
