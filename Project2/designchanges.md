# Behavior Decisions in Project 2
- () and Head() are methods
- Front() and back() will throw runtime exceptions
- Begin() and end() will never throw runtime exceptions
- Copy Constructor will never throw exception
- Copy constructor on Queue will only accept queues
- Iterator constructors are inclusive bounds in same order
- Queue Push has non reference alternative
- Queue does not return reference
